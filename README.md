The purpose of this project is to give the user inspiration about different cities they are interested in moving to. The user searches for a city and is returned a list of local Github users and photos of the given city. If there are many users in that city, the chance of it being a tech hub with a good amount of jobs is higher. The images help the user visualize being in the city. 

This project was built in JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, and HTML. The jQuery is used to build event listeners. Following the initital search query, Javascript uses the pixabay.com API to search through related photos. GitHub REST API is used to display GitHub users.
